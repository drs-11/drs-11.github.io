<p>Welcome to our ideas page. It&rsquo;s great you want to start early. Please
join us in our slack channel! (we&rsquo;ll leave as an exercise to you to
find it — it&rsquo;s on our website).</p>
<p>*<strong>*This is an &ldquo;new way of doing things year&rdquo;</strong>**. GSoC projects are
now supposed to take around 175 hours and we&rsquo;ve adapted our ideas to
reflect that. If you think any idea is too long or too short please let
us know - we still need to fine tune this!</p>
<p>As you will see, this year has a lot of Rust. The reason is simple:
Security. Our C code base has known (and we suspect, a lot of unknown)
security issues caused by the usual memory management in C. Lots of
people have touched the code over the years, and it shows.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also Flutter, which we love, and more.</p>
<p>We will provide resources for students — we&rsquo;ll give access to a
high-speed server, all our samples (we&rsquo;ll even ship a portable drive
with them anywhere in the world, so don&rsquo;t worry about slow connections)
and various other perks.</p>
<p>You are welcome to check out the page (actual ideas at the bottom of the
page, with each project having it&rsquo;s own separate page as well) and start
early in the community bonding process as well as learning a bit about
our code ethics and practices. And of course, we&rsquo;d love you to stay
around even if we are not invited to GSoC or if we cannot invite you as
a student.</p>

  About us
  <a class="anchor" href="#about-us">#</a>
</h3>
<p>We are a small org, which means that your contribution will have a large
impact. It&rsquo;s not going to mean a 0.5% improvement on a big project —
it&rsquo;s going to be more than 10% on a medium size one. If you like
challenges and want a chance to shine this is your place.</p>
<p>We have -we think- statistically amazing continuity in the team: Most
GSoC students from all the past years are still involved, even if they
are no longer eligible as students. They still contribute code, and they
mentor both in GSoC and the sister program GCI. As mentors, they also
come to the Summer of Code summit which traditionally takes place in
October.</p>
<p>We have *mentors all over the world* (North America, Europe, Asia and
Australia), so time zones are never a problem. Our main channel of
communication is a <a href="https://ccextractor.org/public:general:support">Slack
channel</a> to which
everyone is welcome. We expect all accepted students to be available on
Slack very often, even if you don&rsquo;t need to talk to your mentor. This
will help you ask questions when necessary, and you might be able to
help others out as well while working on your project.</p>
<p><strong>Exception</strong>: If your country (such as <strong>Russia</strong>) has banned Slack
please get in touch in we&rsquo;ll work out a solution with you. We absolutely
want you to participate.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ccextractor-dev">mailing
list</a> is also
available for those that prefer email over slack. It&rsquo;s a new mailing
list (the old one hasn&rsquo;t been used in a long time) but it&rsquo;s read by
everyone involved in GSoC.</p>
<p><strong>All our top committers will be mentoring</strong>. Many of them are former
GSoC students or winners of GCI.</p>
<h3 id="perks">
  Perks
  <a class="anchor" href="#perks">#</a>
</h3>
<p><span class="underline">All accepted students get a programming book
immediately after being accepted</span>, with the hope that they read
them before the coding starts. We want to see if this increases the
quality of the work. So far we have selected these three books (pick
one), but we&rsquo;re open to suggestions: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean
Code</a>,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders/dp/1537713949">Elements of Programming Interviews in
Python</a>,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850">Cracking the code
interview</a>.</p>
<p>We will also provide to all accepted students: - 6 months of access
(from the acceptance date) to all courses in
<a href="https://www.educative.io/">educative.io</a> - 12 months of access (from
the acceptance date) to <a href="https://backtobackswe.com">backtobackswe</a>,
which is a fantastic resource to learn algorithms, prepare for coding
interviews, and in general learn fundamentals.</p>
<p>The student working on CEA-708 will also receive a copy of the latest
CEA-708 specification document.</p>
<h3 id="about-what-we-use">
  About what we use
  <a class="anchor" href="#about-what-we-use">#</a>
</h3>
<p>This is what we use <strong>today</strong>. It doesn&rsquo;t mean this is what we want to
continue using. Probably not — we&rsquo;re really open to change. We&rsquo;re just
describing the status quo so you know what you are getting into :-)</p>
<p>The core tool that names the organization (CCExtractor) is a
command-line program written in <strong>C</strong> (not C++).<br>
The current Windows GUI is written in <strong>C#</strong>, and we have another GUI
for Linux that&rsquo;s written with Qt, and a small GUI that&rsquo;s integrated into
the main program (C). In we&rsquo;re being honest, nothing is great. Good news
for you is that you can start over if you want.<br>
The testing tool we use to run regression tests is mainly written in
<strong>Python</strong>, but it also used Javascript, CSS and some shell scripting.
The Test suite is written in C#. One of the projects this year is about
replacing it.<br>
The prototype real time subtitle website is written in <strong>NodeJS</strong>.<br>
We also have a number of support tools that do a number of different
things, from downloading subtitles from streaming services to
translating them with Google Translate or DeepL. Most of them are
written in <strong>Python</strong>, but since they are small tools that do their job
you don&rsquo;t need to worry much about them.<br>
For totally new things you can use whatever tool you feel is best for
the job.</p>
<h3 id="about-sample-media-and-other-resources">
  About sample media and other resources
  <a class="anchor" href="#about-sample-media-and-other-resources">#</a>
</h3>
<p>We work with huge files. Not all of them are huge, but many are. We know
that many students don&rsquo;t have access to high speed internet. To those
students we will ship (as soon as they are selected) a portable hard
drive with all our samples. So if your internet connection is not good,
don&rsquo;t worry — as long as you can plug a USB drive to your development
computer you can participate with us.</p>
<p>We also have a shared Linux development server with lots of storage and
a Gigabit uplink. Students get an account on it and they are welcome to
use it. There&rsquo;s nothing there except our own work, so it&rsquo;s a trusted
environment (for a server that is connected to internet of course).</p>
<p>The sample platform also hosts a bunch of samples, both which are small
or decently sized.<br>
Some projects have specific requirements: For example to add support for
JokerTV you will need a physical JokerTV device. We will send one to the
student that takes this project well before GSoC starts. The LiveTV
project requires a subscription to YouTube with LiveTV (whatever it&rsquo;s
called this week) and Hulu. We will pay for those. If your project
requires some cloud resources (Google Compute Engine, for example), we
will pay for that, too.</p>
<p>In general, you are not expected to pay for anything (other than your
own development computer and internet, of course) related to any
project.</p>
<p>If you need anything not mentioned (such as a book) let us know. Within
reason, we&rsquo;ll help you.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-projects-and-getting-accepted">
  About the projects and getting accepted
  <a class="anchor" href="#about-the-projects-and-getting-accepted">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Qualification: Our selection system is based on several factors. Of
course no student ranks in all criteria, so don&rsquo;t worry when you read
the list below.</p>
<p><strong>Work on our core tool</strong>: Even if you are going to be working on
something totally different. This might seen counter intuitive, but the
thing is if you prove you can dig into our (messy) code base, find
yourself your way around it, and fix a few bugs, you are just the kind
of person we can trust to &ldquo;figure things out&rdquo;. GSoC is among other
things, a learning experience. No matter what project you decide to work
on, there&rsquo;s going to be roadblocks, things you don&rsquo;t know how to do,
etc. So we really like it when students embrace those situations.</p>
<p><strong>Qualification tasks specific to the project</strong>: The detail page for
some projects contains specific qualification tasks that apply to them.</p>
<p><strong>Contributions to existing open source projects</strong>: This can be
anything. From a good GitHub profile to pull-requests sent to any other
existing project, participation in hackathons, Google Code-In, past
GSoCs and so on.</p>
<p><strong>A good proposal</strong>: This is the one criteria that is non-negotiable.
Your proposal has to be good, period.</p>
<p><strong>Project popularity</strong>: Some ideas just have more competition, so if
participating in GSoC is a top priority for you (over working on a
specific project), consider applying to one of the &ldquo;niche&rdquo; ideas. After
all, that&rsquo;s a great way to get your foot in the door :-)</p>
<p><strong>Best core tool tasks</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re added a difficulty level to all our <a href="https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor/issues">open issues on
GitHub</a>. Best thing
you can do is head there and see if you are able to fix some of the easy
ones and work your way up. We don&rsquo;t expect you to be able to do the hard
ones but we&rsquo;d be impressed if you did :-)</p>
<p>For some of the easy ones you don&rsquo;t even need to know C. Just being able
to compile CCExtractor and dig around a bit will be enough.</p>
<p>The sample platform&rsquo;s issues are tagged with &ldquo;gsoc-proposal-task&rdquo;, so
you can easily see what you can work on.</p>

<p>If instead of working on existing code you&rsquo;d prefer to show us your

<h3 id="community-etiquette">
  Community etiquette
  <a class="anchor" href="#community-etiquette">#</a>
</h3>
<p>It goes without saying that everyone in the community has to be polite
and respectful, and consider everyone else a member of a team and not a
competitor.</p>
<p>All developers are part of the team, by the way. Our Slack channel has
mentors, code-in participants, other students, or developers and users
that are none of the above but they all play some kind of role in
CCExtractor&rsquo;s community.</p>
<p>Part of being respectful is giving consideration to everyone else&rsquo;s
time. Most of us have day jobs, and as such are limited in the time we
can use to guide you. We&rsquo;d like to spend it on quality discussions, and
not on things that are for example written on this website, things that
you can easily retrieve by reading documentation on used libraries or on
the software&rsquo;s help screen. Asking this kind of questions in the Slack
channel shows little respect for our time. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t
ask questions, but remember that being a clueless user and a lazy
developer are two very different things. If you ask those questions you
will probably get an answer as if you were a clueless user (polite no
matter what), but if you apply to GSoC you will be considered a lazy
developer. Google is your friend ;)</p>
<p>Tell things as you see them. Politely -you&rsquo;re not Linus-, but don&rsquo;t
sugar-coat it. We know some parts of our code is poorly written, poorly
documented, etc. It stands out, so you will know when you dig in. No one
is going to be offended by having that code rewritten or refactored.
Peer review applies to everybody&rsquo;s work and is done by everybody.</p>

<p>Because we use a number of libraries and in fact &ldquo;are a library&rdquo;
ourselves (meaning other programs can link CCExtractor as a library, or
invoke the binary) we interact with other communities and their
software. From time to time there&rsquo;s a chance to do something interesting
that affects CCExtractor and something else (FFmpeg comes to mind, but
also Kodi, VLC, libGPAC, Red Hen, to mention just a few of our friends
that typically participate in Summer of Code). So how does this work? As
long as the work benefits CCExtractor and it&rsquo;s part of your summer
project, we&rsquo;re OK with you spending some time on the other project. For
example if you are improving our MP4 support, for which we use libGPAC,
and need to fix or improve something on libGPAC you are welcome to do
so. If you do, make sure you submit your changes to their maintainers
and follow through with their merge process.</p>
<h3 id="your-proposal">
  Your proposal
  <a class="anchor" href="#your-proposal">#</a>
</h3>
<p>You can propose to do any of the following ideas, or you can bring your
own. In any case, make sure you run them by us before you actually
submit your proposal.<br>
At the very least your proposal needs to<br>
- Explain what you do want to do, why it is important to you (don&rsquo;t
make up a story here — the reason can be that you need it, that you just
think it&rsquo;s cool, that you have an itch to work on it, etc), and why it
could be important or useful to us.<br>
- Explain how you intend to accomplish the goal, in enough detail that
makes it clear that you have done your homework. For example, &ldquo;I will
modify the CCExtractor binary so that it&rsquo;s able to convert audio to text
with perfect accuracy&rdquo; is the same thing as sending your proposal to the
trash. You need to have a plan.<br>
- Detail the timeline explaining what the expected progress is for each
week or every two weeks (pay special attention to the milestones within
the GSoC timeline itself, of course) and how we should validate the
results.<br>
- Detail what kind of support you will need from us. For example, if
you are going to need test streams, hardware, access to a server, etc,
let us know, so we can prepare everything for you as soon as possible.<br>
- Detail your expected working hours in UTC. We&rsquo;re used to weird
working schedules, so don&rsquo;t worry about working in the middle of the
night, or weekends instead of other days, etc. Knowing your hours may
help us to match you better with a mentor.<br>
- Mention your planned absences. We don&rsquo;t need you to detail what you
will be doing when you are not working of course, but if you are going
away for any reason we need to know so we don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve
abandoned.<br>
- Link to your GitHub (or any other repository) profile, if you have
one, so we can take a look at your previous work.<br>
- GSoC is a coding program: This means that ideas that are about
testing (unless it involves coding something to test our programs ;) ),
website design, etc, are out.<br>
- However, we want to have good documentation: Make sure you have time
to write a good technical article explaining your work.<br>
- Be realistic and honest with the timeline. Consider each week you
should work around 30 hours. If your timeline reserves a lot of time for
minor things we&rsquo;ll think that you are not going to be working full-time
in GSoC. On the other hand if you promise to do things in a lot less
than that it seems realistic to us it will seem that you don&rsquo;t really
know how much work things take.<br>
- If you are going to be using 3rd party libraries (that&rsquo;s OK), make
sure to validate that their license is compatible with GPLv2 (which is
ours). List the libraries in your proposal. Check that they are
cross-platform. If you will need to extend those libraries in any way
please explain. In this case, your proposal should include time to get
that extension submitted to the maintainers (we love to contribute to
other projects).</p>
<p>Something else: Mentors often have their fingers in several pies. If you
send the same proposal to several orgs everyone will know. So do
yourself a favor and don&rsquo;t do that. You can apply to several
organizations and that&rsquo;s totally fine, but each organization will want
to see that you have put the time to write a great proposal that is
focused on them.</p>
