#### Slack

Slack is a great communication tool. Most CCExtractor developers hang
out in a slack team. You're welcome to request an invitation here:
{slackinvite}

#### Technical issues

By far the best way to get report issues is by opening a ticket at
[GitHub's issue
tracker](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor/issues).

When creating a ticket:

\- Make sure you are using the last CCExtractor version.  
\- If it's a new thing (for example a video file that a previous
CCExtractor version processed OK and now causes a crash) mention the
last version you know was correct.  
\- If the issue is about a specific file, make that file available for
us. Don't just send us the output from CCExtractor, we can't do anything
about a screenshot that shows a crash, we need the input that actually
causes it. Preferably you make it available for us on the [Sample
Platform](https://sampleplatform.ccextractor.org), but you can also
upload the file to Dropbox, Google Drive, etc, and add a download link
to your ticket.  
\- If you cannot make the file public for any (reasonable) reason you
can send us a private invitation (both Dropbox and Google Drive allow
that). In this case we will download the file and upload it to the
private developer repository.  
\- Do not upload your file to any location that will require us to sign
up or endure a wait list, slow downloads, etc.  
\- If your upload expires make sure you keep it active somehow (replace
links if needed). Keep in mind that while we go over all tickets some
may take a few days, and it's important we have the file available when
we actually need it.  
\- Make sure you set an alert in GitHub so you get notifications about
your ticket. We may need to ask questions and we do everything inside
GitHub's system.  
\- Please use English.  
\- It goes without saying, we like polite people.  

#### Mailing list

We do have a mailing list available on
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ccextractor-dev>, and all
GitHub issues are posted here.

It's read by the right people; you can use it if you prefer it to Slack.

#### Email

If you need to use email, you can reach the organisation's admin on the
next email address:
